# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sentinel plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning is per-plugin. The authoritative version lives in
`sentinel/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; this changelog records what changed at each
version. A "release" is the version bump landing on the default branch, consumed by
users via a marketplace update — there is no separate publish step.

PRs append their change under `## [Unreleased]`, using the appropriate `Added` /
`Changed` / `Deprecated` / `Removed` / `Fixed` / `Security` subheading (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`). `scripts/release.sh <version>` promotes those entries to a dated
release heading.
